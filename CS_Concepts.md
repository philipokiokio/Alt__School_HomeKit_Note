CORE Conceprts Algorithms and Data Structure.


1. Big O Notation 
This is a consideration of Algorithm run time. How long will it take a this solution to run compared to this other solution. 
if this solution is faster than this solution would that still be the case when the problems presented to the algo increases.

If the solution run time is the same we consider the output to be constant, this is called O(1)

Big O notation is key to analyizing the effiency and scalabilty of algorithms. Big O represents the worst case scenario of an algo.




2. Sorting Algorithms
This is the method of arranging and sorting things held in association that its hapharzard state to a refined well sorted thing. The issue is the ability to solve this problem in the fastest, less computable expensive ammount of time.




3. Recursion 

This is a repeative step wise action aimed at a particular problem with the sole aim of reaching the solution.


4. Big Data

Big Data are data that too large and complex that it is impossible to manage with conventional data processing tools.


5. Data Structures 
These are tools that software engineers should at least know.

They are 

Array: this a collection of elements, which are identified by at least one array index or key


Tree: A tree is a widely used data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and sub trees of children with a parent node.

Stack: this a data tyoe that serves as a collection of elements, with two main operations which are

* Push and Pop
push adds elements to the stack and Pop removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. it is alternative name is LIFO (Last In first one out)

Queue: this is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.

Graph: an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and the directed graph concepts from the field of graph theory within mathematics.

Hash Table: This is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. Hash table uses a hash function to compute an index which is also called a hash code into an array of buckets.

Linked List: This is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by ther physical placement in memory but instead each element points to the next.

Heap: this is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentiallu an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property in a max heap.
