CORE Conceprts Algorithms and Data Structure.


1. Big O Notation 
This is a consideration of Algorithm run time. How long will it take a this solution to run compared to this other solution. 
if this solution is faster than this solution would that still be the case when the problems presented to the algo increases.

If the solution run time is the same we consider the output to be constant, this is called O(1)

Big O notation is key to analyizing the effiency and scalabilty of algorithms. Big O represents the worst case scenario of an algo.




2. Sorting Algorithms
This is the method of arranging and sorting things held in association that its hapharzard state to a refined well sorted thing. The issue is the ability to solve this problem in the fastest, less computable expensive ammount of time.




3. Recursion 

This is a repeative step wise action aimed at a particular problem with the sole aim of reaching the solution.


4. Big Data

Big Data are data that too large and complex that it is impossible to manage with conventional data processing tools.


5. Data Structures 
These are tools that software engineers should at least know.

They are 

Array: this a collection of elements, which are identified by at least one array index or key


Tree: A tree is a widely used data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and sub trees of children with a parent node.

Stack: this a data tyoe that serves as a collection of elements, with two main operations which are

* Push and Pop
push adds elements to the stack and Pop removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. it is alternative name is LIFO (Last In first one out)

Queue: this is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.

Graph: an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and the directed graph concepts from the field of graph theory within mathematics.

Hash Table: This is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. Hash table uses a hash function to compute an index which is also called a hash code into an array of buckets.

Linked List: This is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by ther physical placement in memory but instead each element points to the next.

Heap: this is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentiallu an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property in a max heap.



Core Concept Artificial Intelligence


6. Greedy Algorithms 
this  algo chooses the best available choice and ignores the rest.

7. Hill Climbing 
This is an algorithm that finds a better solution by generation a neighbouring solution. Each neighboring solution is generated based on the best solution.

8. Simulated Annealing

This is a cautious algo that evluates for best path to the solution.

9. Dynamic Programming 
 memoization is an approach in dynamic programing which stores the results of previous computation for future use.



10. Machine Learning 
Making algos smart and more efficient, with out human influence

11. P vs NP Problem
P is a polynomial problem and that is easy for computers to solve. 
NP is a nondeterminstic polynomial problem because it is easy to verify but hard to solve.
NP problems are impossible for computers right now.



Core Concept: Computer Architecture and Engineering 

12. How do computers Work
Computers work by adding complexity on top of complexity. Back to abstraction and computerbilty in computer science. here(Home-Study-Kit/Computer_science.md)

13. Turing and Halting Problem

The haulting problem is the paradox of algorithm being able to solve all problems with out halting.


Core concept: Concurrency
14. Concurrency
this is the property of programs and systems that allow tasks to run in overlapping time periods.

15. Parallelism
This allows 2 or more taks to run at the same time provided that machine has multiprocessing capability.

16. Race Condition
Concurrent events triggers based on the current events. one solution is mutual exclusion.

17. Mutual Exclusion (Mutex)
This prevents another action from occuring while a current transaction is still triggered and it is not completed.

18. Semaphore
i. Binary Semaphore
This will only allow a transaction that is deemed less important to be completed when a transaction of higher importance is completed.

Binary Semaphore 
1= Ongoing transcation
0- waiting



ii. Counting Semaphore
This allows more than 1 process running at the same time.

19. Deadlock
this is when two events with the same cost from two different parties meet at triggers the same action (of various implication) and are both abortive.

 
 Core Concept Computer Security
 20. Computer Hacking

 Hacking is similar to breaking into a house.

 i. Brute force attack:tries every possible key
 ii. Social Engineering:tricking users into revealing their private information.
 iii.Security Exploit: A burglar checks every possible entries to find the easiest way to get in

 iv. Trojan Horse: this is a  malware program that pretends to be useful and runs a malicious code in the background.

 v. Rootkit: this gain admin or root access of a computer through various waus and then disguise as necessary files that is hard to detect by antivirus software.

 vi. Distributed Denial of service Attack (DDos):
 This attempts to bring a site or service down by flooding it with visitors.

 21. Cryptography

 This is the study and application of secure communication.

 2 most widely used cryptographic protocols
 
 i. symmetric cryptography
 Identical keys to access a system.

 ii.Assymetric Cryptography

Public keys and Private keys

Core Concept Software Development Methodologies


22. Waterfall Development

The process of software development, where development cycles are dependent on requirements and completion of each requirement leads to the next requirement.

23. Agile Development

Figure out some of the things needed to be done at the beginning and continously, improve, evolve, collaborate and adapt as the development goes on.

24. Software Development in the realworld.
Pitfall do occur.
