Computer science 

This is the study of problems, problems-solving, and the solution that come out of the problem solving process. 

The Role of a Computer Scientist
The goal of a computer scientist to develop an algorithm, a step by step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise.

Algorithms are finite processes that if followed will solve the problems, they are the step by step process of deconstructing a problem.


CS is the study if algorithms, however some problems may not have solutions.

A comprehensive defination is thus that computer science is the study of problems without solutions and the study of solutions to problems.



Computable problems

This is the description of problems and solutions. This a computable problem is one with an algorithm (Solution)


Expaning Computer science to the study of problems based on computerbility. The computable nature of a problem is independent of the machine (computers).

Abstraction allows us to view the problem and solution in such a way that allows us to seperate the logical and physical perspectives.

Abstraction can be viewed as the interaction of a driver with the car, such as ignition, shift, break, accelerate and steer in order to drive the car. Abstractively the car is thus seen as logically in the eye of the driver, since he uses the car to perform functions that are embedded in the  car. 

These function can be likened to interface, while the mechanic who must repair your automobile takes a very different point of view. The mech not only understand the interface capabilities of an automobile. The mech understands the inner working /algorithmic processes behind each available interface. Thus is know as the physical perspective (abstraction layer) that can be called "Under the Hood"


this analogy is an illustration of computers, users interact with computer using its interface to achieve their tasks and their views are sternly logical or user-centric. Software engineers and all core computing related roles are the mechanics in this case.



Abstraction when presented to the user hides the processes and functionality of the interface, the user can only assume the underlying processes

```
    import math


    math.sqrt(16)

    4.0 

```

This python block is an example of an abstraction (Procedural abstraction), where the process of calculation the sqrt is not seen, we can only assume that the function will provide us the correct results.

We only know that someone implemented a solution to the square root problem but we only know how to use it, this is reffered to as the black box view of process.
